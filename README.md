# OlvynSpells
## Version 2.2.1

This is a mod for BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, and EET. It adds over 150 new spells to the game, including spells that let you fly or move through walls. Many of the new spells require <a href='https://github.com/Bubb13/EEex'>EEex</a>, so I recommend you install that first if you are on Windows.

Updated by me to allow Olvynspells to partially work with 2.6+EEex, so as to be equivalent to Olvynspells without EEex.
